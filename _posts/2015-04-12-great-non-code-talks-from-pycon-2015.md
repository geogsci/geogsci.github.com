PyCon 2015 was a great experience. I went to a wide variety of talks, from those that were super technical to others that were widely applicable to work and life in general. 

Here are two of the latter, which I particularly enjoyed. 

## Workplace cultures and diversity

My highlight talk of the conference was by [Kate Heddleston](https://twitter.com/heddle317) presenting insights into workplace cultures and diversity. Everyone should watch this, or just read her blog posts on [Criticism and Feedback](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/criticism-and-ineffective-feedback), [Onboarding](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/onboarding-and-the-cost-of-team-debt), [Argument Cultures](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/argument-cultures-and-unregulated-aggression) and [The Null Process](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/the-null-process).

## A normal distribution of talent and ability

A great talk for anyone who has felt [Imposter Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), was the keynote by [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://twitter.com/jacobian). Well worth a watch.
